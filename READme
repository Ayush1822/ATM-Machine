# ATM-Machine
A miniproject on implementing operations of ATM Machine which includes Deposit, withdraw of amount and balance enquiry of an account using C.

## Features

Since it is an ATM Machine. Initially I declared some of the accounts and initialized the amount to zero. And doing following operations on that account.

1) Deposit

2) Withdrawal

3) Balance Enquiry

## Modules

1) Validation

2) Deposit
 
3) Withdrawal

4) Balance Enquiry

Logic Gates
Explained

AND Gate

The AND gate is used to
combine multiple conditions,
ensuring that all inputs must be
true for the output to be true.

OR Gate

The OR gate is used to check if
at least one of the multiple
conditions is true, allowing for
more flexible decision-making.

NOT Gate

The NOT gate is used to negate
the input, reversing the true/false
value and enabling more
complex logical operations.

Overview of C Code

1

Modular Design

The ATM management
system is typically
developed using modular C
code, allowing for easy
maintenance and
scalability.

2

Input Validation

The C code ensures robust
input validation to prevent
unauthorized access and
secure customer
transactions.

3

Database
Integration

The C code integrates with
the bank's database to
retrieve and update
customer account
information seamlessly.
