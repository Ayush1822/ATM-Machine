Introduction to ATM
Management System

The ATM (Automated Teller Machine) management system is a crucial
component of modern banking infrastructure. It enables customers to perform
various financial transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance
inquiries, without the need for direct interaction with a bank teller.


ATM Withdrawal
Process

Card Insertion

The customer inserts their debit or credit card into the ATM to initiate the
withdrawal process.

The customer selects the desired withdrawal amount from the available options on
the ATM interface.

ATM Deposit Process

Logic Gates
Explained

AND Gate

The AND gate is used to
combine multiple conditions,
ensuring that all inputs must be
true for the output to be true.

OR Gate

The OR gate is used to check if
at least one of the multiple
conditions is true, allowing for
more flexible decision-making.

NOT Gate

The NOT gate is used to negate
the input, reversing the true/false
value and enabling more
complex logical operations.

Overview of C Code

1

Modular Design

The ATM management
system is typically
developed using modular C
code, allowing for easy
maintenance and
scalability.

2

Input Validation

The C code ensures robust
input validation to prevent
unauthorized access and
secure customer
transactions.

3

Database
Integration

The C code integrates with
the bank's database to
retrieve and update
customer account
information seamlessly.
